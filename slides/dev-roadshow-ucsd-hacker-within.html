# What is The Hacker Within

* Meeting of researchers who are always learning new **tips and tricks** to make their computational work flow more smoothly
* Peers at all **levels of experience** share topics useful in our scientific software development workflows
* Great venue for introducing **new libraries**, showing off **useful features** of a tool you are using, or bringing up a **problem** youâ€™re having

---


# Example Topics from Other Chapters

???
* Discussing computational problems with a project
* Useful features or tips-and-tricks of a programming language used in a project
* Demonstrating and discussing a project or technology
* Python, Machine Learning, RStudio, Bash, Visualizations, HPC, Git

## How it works:

]
.right-column[
1. First meeting of the quarter is used to generate topics and schedule talks
   * E.g. What do you want to learn? What would you like to teach? 
2. We gather and go through a round of introductions
3. A volunteer will give a tutorial or lead a discussion about a computational topic
4. There will be a time for a couple of Lightning Talks, which are 5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or question of interest to the group

.left-column[
## Who is this for?
]
.right-column[
* Anyone interested in software development best practices
* Anyone who wants to share a tip or trick, a new library, show off useful features of a scientific library or programming language, or bringing up a computational problem
* Anyone who wants to learn about the above

## Why 
]
.right-column[
>The Hacker Within isn't a class and no one is required to attend. We show up to have fun and to learn. Hopefully, your tutorial will teach something useful in a way that is enjoyable. To do this, please consider bringing your A-game. That is, find the enthusiastic tinkering problem-solver inside yourself (The Hacker Within yourself) and bring that version of yourself to share that enthusiasm with us. Enthusiasm is infectious! - https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley ]
