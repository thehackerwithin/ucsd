# Who

Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to come to our meetings.

# What

* A weekly or monthly meeting for sharing skills and best practices for scientific computation. In these friendly sessions, peers at all levels of experience share topics useful in our scientific software development workflows.

This meeting would be a great venue for introducing new libraries, showing off useful features of a scientific library or programming language you’re using, or bringing up a computational problem you’re having.
